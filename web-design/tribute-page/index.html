                <p>Edward Snowden, a former Central Intelligence Agency technical worker, is the source of one of the worst information leaks in US history. Materials provided by Mr Snowden to the media allege the US has conducted widespread and illegal surveillance of its citizens and other nations. The BBC looks at how the affair has developed since it broke in June.</p>
